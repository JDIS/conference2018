        <h2>Aperçu de la présentation</h2>
        <h3>How the bunny saves you money:  consumer airfare prediction and other challenges at Hopper</h3>
        <p>Buying a plane ticket is a time-consuming and frustrating process that often leaves the consumer unhappy. Flight prices are less transparent and fluctuate more than almost anything else a consumer buys, even though airfare is one of the most expensive purchases for a typical family.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our goal at Hopper is to bring more transparency to pricing, by giving consumers advice about where and when to fly -- and when to buy -- to save money on their air travel. We believe this helps consumers buy more quickly, with less effort, and ultimately be happier with their purchase decision. One of our key features is our "when to buy" advice: we'll watch prices for your trip and notify you when the price is right.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Recommending when to buy is tough for two main reasons: first is the airfare marketplace and its idiosyncrasies present unique analytical challenges, and second is that the prediction must be highly consumer-friendly: both easy comprehensible and immediately actionable. If we're too conservative and tell you to buy too early, we risk missing out on a better deal later, but if we're too optimistic and wait too long, you could end up paying more as prices rise towards your departure date. Because prices change at the whim of the airlines in unpredictable ways, it's impossible to know for sure. But this session will outline how we've tackled these challenges to help consumers save 10% on average, and up to 40% in some cases.</p>
